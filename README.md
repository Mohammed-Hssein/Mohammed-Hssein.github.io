I am a master student of applied mathematics at [University of Lille](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A9_de_Lille). I'm also studying general engineering, majoring in data science and artificial intelligence (SDIA programm) at [École Centrale de Lille](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_centrale_de_Lille). Check SDIA programm [here](http://pierrechainais.ec-lille.fr/Centrale/Option_DAD/Accueil.html) 


## Research activities
* **Deep learning on Grassmannian data** with Rémy Boyer, and Jérémie Boulanger. Improuving a neural network architecture for grassmannina learning, on grassmanian input data. Project conducted during an internship at CNRS. check the report [here](mohammed-hssein.github.io/internship.pdf).

## Deep learning implementations
* **First step towards deep networks** is an implementation of the ANN architecture from A to Z based on famous [book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) of M.Nielsen. The ANN architecture is implementd with basic numpy functions and python build-in functions. check it [here](https://github.com/Mohammed-Hssein/Deep-Learning-Architecture).

## Machine learning algorithms
* **ML algorithms with Scikit-learn** is a set of ML algorithms implemented with the ***Scikit-learn*** library. It contains many ***Supervised*** and ***Unsupervised*** learning algorihtms, such as **K-means, SVM, KNN, XGBoost, ...**.
